# AI Agent for Automated Information Retrieval

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of an AI Agent designed for automated information retrieval. The agent utilizes advanced algorithms to process queries, retrieve relevant information, and present the results in a user-friendly format.

## Features

- **Automated Query Handling**: Accepts user queries and processes them efficiently.
- **Information Retrieval**: Retrieves relevant information from various sources.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Easy-to-navigate application for seamless usage.
- **Scalable Design**: Built to handle multiple queries and data sources simultaneously.

   cd AI-Agent-for-Automated-Information-Retrieval
   
2. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
3. (Optional) Set up a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # For Unix
   venv\Scripts\activate      # For Windows
   
### Configuration
- Update any API keys or credentials in the config.py file (if applicable).
- Configure the application settings (like database, endpoint URLs, etc.) in app.py or a .env file.
